To open the admin panel, you may use these credentials:
Email: gh@gmail.com
Password: 12345678

Note that:
All users have to verify their emails if they wish to register\login to send an email through the contact form.
All users will get number "1" as a default value for the column "published" and that means they are only allowed to see the main pages of the website.
If we decide that a certain user can be an admin then, we have to change the value of "published" column from "1" to "0" manually in the database. Thus, they will be able to see all pages of the admin panel. Also, they will have the permission to add,edit or delete any information in these pages.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
